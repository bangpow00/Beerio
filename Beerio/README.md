## EF + Scaffolded MVC

In this branch I explored the idea of EF with MVC scaffolding with Razor. 
I took the general data design idea that I had tried to flush 
out in the database-less, and attempted to implement it with Razor
pages. The goal was to flush an end-to-end proof of concept. In a quick way. 
Having spent 2 years working on a large legacy code base that is a mixture 
of webforms, MVC, and large database, I understimated the time it would take 
to do an initial setup. As well as the time get up to speed with Razor. 
Consequently I ran out of time before I could get things where I wanted.

I still liked the idea that a Recipe of make up of a list of RecipeIngredient
items.  Where a RecipeIngredient contains an Ingredient ID and a quantity.
Getting the mapping from a Recipe to a RecipeIngredient to an Ingredient, so I
could display the Ingredient name on a page is where I ran out of time.

So thinking more about that mapping, is where I would spend more time.
